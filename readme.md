My CV in markdown. It is an effort to have a CV in markdown and generate nice html from it.

The CSS I made tries to mimic STRIPPED DOWN RESUME TEMPLATE by [Matt Brown](http://thingsthatarebrown.com/). 

I also used reset.css by [Eric Meyer](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).

There is a make file that show how to compile it using [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).
