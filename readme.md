My CV in markdown. It is also an effort to generate a nice html resume from markdown.

The CSS I made tries to mimic `STRIPPED DOWN RESUME TEMPLATE` by [Matt Brown](http://thingsthatarebrown.com/). 

I also used `reset.css` by [Eric Meyer](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).

There is a make file that shows how to compile it using [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).
